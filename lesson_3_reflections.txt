When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to be able to work on the project from multiple locations, or when you want to back it up in case something happens.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You don't want Git to overwrite the local files with what's on the remote, since they may be older than the newest work.
