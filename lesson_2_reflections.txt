What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The files in the directory the repository was initialized in are now on git to be tracked. It allows us to create new projects in git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is just a temporary place where git stores files that you are planning to add in a commit. The working directory contains all the files you have and the repository contains the files and their histories that you have added. The staging area allows you to carefully plan and control your commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	You can just add the files that you want to be changed in each commit to the staging area intsead of pushing all of the changed files at once in a single commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would be helpful when implementing large new changes or testing out a new feature, allowing you to keep the main version as well as work on the new experimental branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They show the connections between all the commits in their respective branches and helps show the relationships between all the commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	A new commit is formed that combines the changes at the tips of the two merged branches. We represent it as a convergence of branches because it will point back to both its parent branches.
